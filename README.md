# MinimalGallery
The Minimal Gallery is a simple way to display maps and apps in a gallery. It is a configurable group application designed to be embedded in a web page or used as a standalone gallery. The Group Gallery presents a collection maps and apps as cards in a clean and simple design. Maps and apps can be previewed directly in the gallery or opened for full screen viewing and capabilities.

  * Choose to open the map in a new window or over the gallery. 
  * Choose a color option (card, card captions, background, text)
  * Supports organization shared theme settings
